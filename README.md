# Advent of Code (2018)

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) repo with my code. I've written the code myself, and you're welcome to use it...
but you should really try to solve the problems by yourself! With that said, feel free to email me if you find any problems.

Also, I'm open to criticism, if there's a more Pythonic way of doing something, feel free to let me know!
